## Introduction of the project: Women Safety

* Safety is a fundamental human right and shouldn't be considered a luxury for women. It is the foundation in achieving gender equality. It will create a safer environment that can encourage women to step out of their homes without any worry which will also increase their productivity and give them the confidence to explore opportunities in various fields.

* We are building a website to have a solution which will help to curb sexual assault pandemic. Firstly the user will login themselves then the contact information of their five guardians would be asked.Now if the user is feeling unsafe or just wants to check in, a live location can be activated and can be shared with guardians. It is able to trigger an emergency alert with a double-press, instantly transmitting location information to selected contacts.
*  If you do send an alert, it lets your guardians navigate to your location. This feature is useful to help people reach you quickly. 
*  In this way it will be able to keep users safe through these SOS features. One of its applications enables users to enter their start point and destination, in case they feel the route is unsafe. The location of the device can be tracked real time.
*  We have also added the virtual facetime,audio illusion in the application as sometimes it may happen that you feel unsafe in the path you are travelling and you have no one to talk to you can use talk to me feature. If you are at home sometimes you feel like nothing to do you can also learn self defence through get the self defense training option. Of Course our application will also cover basic features like editing your profile,notification bar, chat with guardians,etc.
*   If this part will get implemented successfully then we will add some more features like professional chatbot from which you can talk to professionals/police/1098 facilities,unique trigger speech system that allows you to add a unique word of your choice and trigger the alert by the unique word just like okay google.
